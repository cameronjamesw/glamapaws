            <h1 class="heading">About Glamapaws</h1>
            <p>Welcome to <mark class="white">Glamapaws</mark> (our official prefix granted by the Kennel Club since 2012). We are <mark class="white">licensed breeders</mark> of quality
                puppies will grow up to be perfect additions to families.
                We have worked very hard throughout the years to produce puppies of excellent quality by selecting exceptional dogs from
                the beginning.</p><br>
                <p>All of our beloved dogs are <mark class="white">thoroughly vet checked</mark> and <mark class="white">vaccinated every year</mark>.
                Year after year I am praised by the vets for the <mark class="white">overall condition</mark> of my dogs and their <mark class="white">incredible temperament</mark>.
                None of my dogs have <mark class="underline">ever</mark> failed their vet inspections and all are <mark class="white">passed every year as Fit to breed</mark>, something that is
                very very important - <mark class="white">healthy parents breed healthy puppies</mark>. The above is something that most breeders do not do, hence
                the huge rise in poor quality puppies.</p><br>
                <p>We are also <mark class="white">inspected unannounced</mark> and this can be at any day and any time by our licensing authority, meaning that our
                standards are kept very high <mark class="underline">at all times</mark>.</p><br>
                <p>We work incredibly hard at our establishment and we absolutely deserve the outstanding reputation that we have.
                Our dogs and puppies have the very best and <mark class="white">no expenses are spared</mark>.</p>

        <h1 class="heading">About Our Pups</h1>
        <p>Our puppies leave us <mark class="white">fully vaccinated with two health checks</mark>, meaning they are ready for adventures the day you collect. 
        This is in the best interest of the puppies, us as the breeder and yourselves as the new owners.</p><br>
        <p>Puppies from us are <mark class="white">exposed to all general household noises</mark> including hoovers, radios, pots and pans, and our happy
        (noisy) children.</p><br>
        <p>They truly leave us absolutely bomb proof, full of confidence and fun, this is because of the work and attention that
        we put into our puppies from the second that they are born to the moment that they leave us for their new homes.</p> <br>
        <ul id="puppy-list"> <h3>Our puppies leave us..</h3>
            <li>Kennel club regsitered - unless they are a Golden Doodle</li>
            <li>Insured for 4 weeks</li>
            <li>Fully vaccinated</li>
            <li>Fully vet-checked</li>
            <li>Microchipped at home by myself - qualified with certificate of qualification to prove</li>
            <li>Transfer of ownership for the microchip done on the day of collection to ensure no cost to the new owners</li>
            <li>Wormed from 2 weeks of age</li>

            <li>A puppy snuggle blanket</li>
            <li>A bag of their current puppy food</li>
            <li>By getting a puppy from us you are promised a lifetime of support and advice, from a breeder that is literally at the
            end of the phone 24.7 (past puppy owners will agree to this).</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>Here we truly care about our puppies even when they have left us.</p>
