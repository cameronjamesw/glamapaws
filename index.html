            Welcome to <mark class="white">Glamapaws</mark> (our official prefix
            granted by the Kennel Club since 2012). We are
            <mark class="white">licensed breeders</mark> of quality puppies that
            will grow up to be perfect additions to families. We have worked
            very hard throughout the years to produce puppies of excellent
            quality by selecting exceptional dogs from the beginning.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            All of our beloved dogs are
            <mark class="white">thoroughly vet checked</mark> and
            <mark class="white">vaccinated every year</mark>. Year after year I
            am praised by vets for the
            <mark class="white">overall condition</mark> of my dogs and their
            <mark class="white">incredible temperament</mark>. None of my dogs
            have <mark class="underline">ever</mark> failed their vet
            inspections and they all
            <mark class="white"

            <mark class="white">healthy parents breed healthy puppies</mark>.
            The above is something that most breeders do not do, hence the huge
            rise in poor quality puppies.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We are also <mark class="white">inspected unannounced</mark> and
            this can be at any day and any time by our licensing authority,
            meaning that our standards are kept very high
            <mark class="underline">at all times</mark>.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We work incredibly hard at our establishment and we absolutely
            deserve the outstanding reputation that we have. Our dogs and
            puppies have the very best and
            <mark class="white">no expenses are spared</mark>.

          <p>
            Our puppies leave us
            <mark class="white">fully vaccinated with two health checks</mark>,
            meaning they are ready for adventures from the day you collect them.
            This is in the best interest of the puppies; me as the breeder and
            yourselves as the new owners.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Puppies from us are
            <mark class="white">exposed to all general household noises</mark>
            including hoovers, radios, pots & pans, and our happy (and noisy)
            children.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            They truly leave us absolutely bomb proof, full of confidence and
            fun, this is because of the work and attention that we put into our
            puppies from the second that they are born to the moment that they
            leave us for their new homes.
