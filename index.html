            <h1 class="heading">About Glamapaws</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Glamapaws (our official prefix granted by the Kennel Club since 2012). We are licensed breeders of quality
                puppies will grow up to be perfect additions to families.
                We have worked very hard throughout the years to produce puppies of excellent quality by selecting exceptional dogs from
                the beginning.</p><br>
                <p>All of our beloved dogs are thoroughly vet checked and vaccinated every year.
                Year after year I am praised by the vets for the overall condition of my dogs and their incredible temperament.
                None of my dogs have EVER failed their vet inspections and all are passed every year as Fit to breed, something that is
                very very important - healthy parents breed healthy puppies. The above is something that most breeders do not do, hence
                the huge rise in poor quality puppies.</p><br>
                <p>We are also inspected UNANNOUNCED and this can be at any day and any time by our licensing authority, meaning that our
                standards are kept VERY high AT ALL TIMES.</p><br>
                <p>We work incredibly hard at our establishment and we absolutely deserve the outstanding reputation that we have.
                Our dogs and puppies have the very best and no expenses are spared.</p>

        <h1 class="heading">About Our Pups</h1>
        <p>Our puppies leave us fully vaccinated with two health checks, meaning they are ready for adventures the day you collect. 
        This is in the best interest of the puppies, us as the breeder and yourselves as the new owners.</p>
        <p>Puppies from us are exposed to all general household noises including hoovers, radios, pots and pans, and our happy
        (noisy) children.</p>
        <p>They truly leave us absolutely bomb proof, full of confidence and fun, this is because of the work and attention that
        we put into our puppies from the second that they are born to the moment that they leave us for their new homes.</p>
        Our puppies leave us..

            <li>A bag of their current puppy food</li>
            <li>By getting a puppy from us you are promised a lifetime of support and advice, from a breeder that is literally at the
            end of the phone 24.7 (past puppy owners will agree to this).</li>
        </ul>
        Here we truly care about our puppies even when they have left us.
