Visit the deployed site: [Glamapaws](https://cameronjamesw.github.io/glamapaws/index.html)

Welcome to Glamapaws, a dog-breeding website designed to attract more clients for the dog breeder at hand, Jodie Thomas of Glamapaws.

With over 30% of households owning a dog within the United Kingdon, the utilisation of trust-worthy dog breeders continues to grow. However with so many breeders using third-party websites to host their advertisements, it is becoming harder for clients to narrow down reliable and trusted breeders. 

With Glamapaws, Jodie now has her own personal website that eliminates the need to use a third-party website, and in turn the business goal hopes to see a growth in clients through transparency and commitment to her business.

### Future Features 

- __Reviews__

    - After speaking with Jodie since the final deployment of the website, I am looking to implement a reviews section either within the home page, or seperately within a 'reviews' page. A review section would pose further transparency to future users through sharing past clients' experiences. 

- __Breeds Expansion__
- 
    - Further detail within each of the breeds pages is neccessary. The information is very basic right now, so links to extennal sources such a official breed pages and YouTube videos would be beneficial to the user.
