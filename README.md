Welcome to Glamapaws, a dog-breeding website designed to attract more clients for the dog breeder at hand, Jodie Thomas of Glamapaws.

With over 30% of households owning a dog within the United Kingdon, the utilisation of trust-worthy dog breeders continues to grow. However with so many breeders using third-party websites to host their advertisements, it is becoming harder for clients to narrow down reliable and trusted breeders. 

With Glamapaws, Jodie now has her own personal website that eliminates the need to use a third-party website, and in turn the business goal hopes to see a growth in clients through transparency and commitment to her business.
