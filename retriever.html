            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>One of the most intelligent and affectionate dog breeds.</li>
              <li>
                They have a strong willingness to learn, explore and be trained.
              </li>
              <li>
                They prefer wide open spaces where they can run around freely –
                if they are kept cooped up without attention then they will
                release their energy through more destructive methods.
              </li>
              <li>
                Regular training and attention is required to mentally and
                physically stimulate this breed.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Muscular and medium sized dog.</li>
              <li>They have a life expectancy of around 12 years.</li>
              <li>
                An occasional visit to the vets will be required as they will
                require vaccines and boosters from time to time!
              </li>
              <li>
                They require regular exercise, around 30 minutes per day.
                Without regular exercise, they can become sad, destructive, and
                aggressive.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Temperament</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                They are obedient and have a strong sense of purpose within
                family life – they will be able to fit into almost any family
                environment.
              </li>
              <li>
                They can make great therapy dogs as they have such a strong
                sense of emotional understanding of those around them.
              </li>
              <li>
                They are great with children, and studies have shown they
                actually aid toddlers with their nature through helping them
                learn to walk and crawl. Due to their sense of purpose, they are
                very protective around children.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Maintenance</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                They require regular baths to fight against ticks, flees and
                skin diseases they could run into whilst exploring.
              </li>
              <li>
                They do not need to be groomed too regularly as they have a
                shedding coat, however brushing them twice a week will be a
                benefit to them, too!
              </li>
            </ul>
